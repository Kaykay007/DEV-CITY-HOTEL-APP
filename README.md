# DEV-CITY-HOTEL-APP
This is a java application for booking hotel rooms which I developed for the Udacity's Java Programming Course. The goal was to create a hotel application which allows users to book and manage room reservations. 
The project emphasizes the use of Java programming language for practicing and elevating fundamental skills as a Java developer.

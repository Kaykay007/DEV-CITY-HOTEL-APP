# DEV-CITY-HOTEL-APP
This is a java application for booking hotel rooms which I developed for the Udacity's Java Programming Course. The goal was to create a hotel application which allows users to book and manage room reservations. 
The project emphasizes the use of Java programming language for practicing and elevating fundamental skills as a Java developer.

# USER SCENERIO

The application provides four user scenarios:

Creating a customer account: The user needs to first create a customer account before they can create a reservation.

Searching for rooms: The app should allow the user to search for available rooms based on provided checkin and checkout dates. If the application has available rooms for the specified date range, a list of the corresponding rooms will be displayed to the user for choosing.

Booking a room: Once the user has chosen a room, the app will allow them to book the room and create a reservation.

Viewing reservations: After booking a room, the app allows customers to view a list of all their reservations.

# ADMIN SCENERIO

The application provides four administrative scenarios:

Displaying all customers accounts.
Viewing all of the rooms in the hotel.
Viewing all of the hotel reservations.
Adding a room to the hotel application.

# Error Requirements

The hotel reservation application handles all exceptions gracefully (user inputs included), meaning:

No crashing: The application does not crash based on user input.
No unhandled exceptions: The app has try and catch blocks that are used to capture exceptions and provide useful information to the user. There are no unhandled exceptions.
